Node js basics 

For my personal reference
It mainly consists of my first server code like

How to create a HTTP Server
How to send request and view response
basic file operation using 'fs' module
simple redirecting
Basic overview working of streams and buffers


Thats it! Now you wasted 2 minutes of your valuable time by reading this SHIT.
