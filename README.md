Node js basics 

For my personal reference
It mainly consists of my first server code 

1. Creating an HTTP Server
Use the http module to create a server.
Set up a request listener to handle incoming requests.

2.Using fs for File Operations
Just performing a simple file operations using fs module and creating text file


3.Simple Redirecting
Check if a request requires redirecting (based on URL or condition).
Use res.writeHead() and res.end() to redirect to a new URL or resource.


Thats it! Now you wasted 2 minutes of your valuable time by reading this SHIT.
